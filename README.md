#Wordpress to Docker Container Import Tool

##Purpose

This is a project to automate the creation of Wordpress Docker containers and
the subsequent import of site content, configuration, and other data from a WP
installation hosted elsewhere.

This tool makes use of the bitnami-docker-wordpress (with modifications), found
here:
https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wordpress


###Required Information:
 * Remote WP install URL
 * ssh/ftp credentials for remote host
 * Path to WP install on remote host
 * MySQL credentials, DB name, hostname



 This is a work in progress!
